- ``geotrellis.vectortile`` (experimental)

  - **New:** ``VectorTile.toGeoJson`` and ``VectorTile.toIterable``.
  - Library simplified by assuming the codec backend will always be Protobuf.

New Features
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Rasterizing ``Geometry`` Layers
*******************************

Finally, the full marriage of the ``vector``, ``raster``, and ``spark`` packages!
You can now transform an ``RDD[Geometry]`` into a writable GeoTrellis layer of
``(SpatialKey, Tile)``!

.. code-block:: scala

   val geoms: RDD[Geometry] = ...
   val celltype: CellType = ...
   val layout: LayoutDefinition = ...
   val value: Double = ...  /* Value to fill the intersecting pixels with */

   val layer: RDD[(SpatialKey, Tile)] with Metadata[LayoutDefinition] =
     geoms.rasterize(value, celltype, layout)

Clipping ``Geometry`` Layers to a Grid
**************************************

In a similar vein to the above, you can now transform an arbitrarily large
collection of Geometries into a proper GeoTrellis layer, where the sections
of each Geometry are clipped to fit inside their enclosing Extents.

.. figure:: img/cliptogrid.png

Here we can see a large ``Line`` being clipped into nine sublines. It's
one method call:

.. code-block:: scala

   import geotrellis.spark._

   val layout: LayoutDefinition = ...  /* The definition of your grid */
   val geoms: RDD[Geometry] = ...      /* Result of some previous work */

   /* There are likely many clipped Geometries per SpatialKey... */
   val layer: RDD[(SpatialKey, Geometry)] = geoms.clipToGrid(layout)

   /* ... so we can group them! */
   val grouped: RDD[(SpatialKey, Iterable[Geometry])] = layer.groupByKey

If clipping on the Extent boundaries is not what you want, there are ways
to customize this. See `the ClipToGrid entry in our Scaladocs <https://geotrellis.github.io/scaladocs/latest/#geotrellis.spark.clip.ClipToGrid$>`__.

Sparkified Viewshed
*******************

A `Viewshed <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viewshed>`__ shows "visibility" from some
set vantage point, given an Elevation raster. Prior to GeoTrellis 1.2 this was possible
at the individual ``Tile`` level but not the Layer (``RDD``) level. Now it is.

First, we need to think about the ``Viewpoint`` type:

.. code-block:: scala

   import geotrellis.spark.viewshed._

   val point: Viewpoint(
     x = ...,                    // some coordinate.
     y = ...,                    // some coordinate.
     viewHeight = 4000,          // 4 kilometres above the surface.
     angle = Math.PI / 2,        // direction that the "camera" faces (in radians). 0 == east.
     fieldOfView = Math.PI / 2,  // angular width of the "view port".
     altitude = 0                // the height of points you're interested in seeing.
   )

In other words:

- x, y, viewHeight: where are we?
- angle: what direction are we looking?
- fieldOfView: how wide are we looking?
- altitude: how high/low is the "target" of our viewing?

Given a ``Seq[Viewpoint]`` (the algorithm supports multiple simultaneous view points),
we can do:

.. code-block:: scala

   // Recall this common alias:
   //   type TileLayerRDD[K] = RDD[(K, Tile)] with Metadata[TileLayerMetadata[K]]

   val layer: TileLayerRDD[SpatialKey] = ...  /* Result of previous work */

   val viewshed: TileLayerRDD[SpatialKey] = layer.viewshed(Seq(point))

Sparkified Euclidean Distance
*****************************

We use *Euclidean Distance* to render a collection of points into a heatmap of
proximities of some area. Say, of two roads crossing:

.. figure:: img/euclid.png

Prior to GeoTrellis 1.2, this was possible at the individual ``Tile`` level
but not the Layer (``RDD``) level. Now it is.

.. code-block:: scala

   /* Result of previous work. Potentially millions of points per SpatialKey. */
   val points: RDD[(SpatialKey, Array[Coordinate])] = ...
   val layout: LayoutDefinition = ...  /* The definition of your grid */

   val layer: RDD[(SpatialKey, Tile)] = points.euclideanDistance(layout)

Polygonal Summaries over Time
*****************************

The following was possible prior to GeoTrellis 1.2:

.. code-block:: scala

   val layer: TileLayerRDD[SpatialKey] = ...
   val polygon: Polgyon = ...

   /* The maximum value within some Polygon overlaid on a Tile layer */
   val summary: Double = layer.polygonalMaxDouble(polygon)

The above is also now possible for layers keyed by ``SpaceTimeKey`` to form
a "time series":

.. code-block:: scala

   val layer: TileLayerRDD[SpaceTimeKey] = ...
   val polygon: MultiPolygon = ...

   /* The maximum value within some Polygonal area at each time slice */
   val summary: Map[ZonedDateTime, Double] = layer.maxSeries(polygon)

Overzooming ``ValueReader``
***************************

A GeoTrellis ``ValueReader`` connects to some layer catalog and lets you read
individual values (usually Tiles):

.. code-block:: scala

   import geotrellis.spark.io.s3._

   val store: AttributeStore = ...
   val reader: Reader[SpatialKey, Tile] = S3ValueReader(store).reader(LayerId("my-catalog", 10))

   val tile: Tile = reader.read(SpatialKey(10, 10))

However ``.reader`` is limited to zoom levels that actually exist for the given layer.
Now you can use ``.overzoomingReader`` to go as deep as you like:

.. code-block:: scala

   import geotrellis.raster.resample._

   val reader: Reader[SpatialKey, Tile] =
     S3ValueReader(store).overzoomingReader(LayerId("my-catalog", 20), Average)

   val tile: Tile = reader.read(SpatialKey(1000, 1000))

Regridding a Tile Layer
***********************

Have you ever wanted to "redraw" a grid over an established GeoTrellis layer?
Say, this 16-tile Layer into a 4-tile one, both of 1024x1024 total pixels:

.. figure:: img/regrid.png

Prior to GeoTrellis 1.2, there was no official way to do this. Now you can use
``.regrid``:

.. code-block:: scala

   /* The result of some previous work. Say each Tile is 256x256. */
   val layer: TileLayerRDD[SpatialKey] = ...

   /* "Recut" the tiles so that each one is now 512x512.
    * No pixels are gained or lost, save some NODATA on the bottom
    * and right edges that may appear for padding purposes.
    */
   val regridded: TileLayerRDD[SpatialKey] = layer.regrid(512)

You can also regrid to non-rectangular sizes:

.. code-block:: scala

   val regridded: TileLayerRDD[SpatialKey] = layer.regrid(tileCols = 100, tileRows = 300)

Robust Layer Querying
**********************

It's common to find a subset of Tiles in a layer that are touched by some given
``Polygon``:

.. code-block:: scala

   val poly: Polygon = ???

   val rdd: TileLayerRDD[SpatialKey] =
    layerReader
       .query[SpatialKey, Tile, TileLayerMetadata[SpatialKey]](Layer("name", zoom))
       .where(Intersects(poly))
       .result

Now you can perform this same operation with ``Line``, ``MultiLine``, and even
``(Polygon, CRS)`` to ensure that your Layer and Geometry always exist in the
same projection.

Improved ``Tile`` ASCII Art
***************************

Sometimes you just want to visualize a ``Tile`` without going
through the song-and-dance of rendering it to a ``.png``. The existing
``Tile.asciiDraw`` method *kind of* does that, except its output is all
in numbers.

The new ``Tile.renderAscii: Palette => String`` method fulfills your heart's desire:

.. code-block:: scala

   import geotrellis.raster._
   import geotrellis.raster.io.geotiff._
   import geotrellis.raster.render.ascii._

   val tile: Tile = SinglebandGeoTiff("path/to/tiff.tiff").tile

   // println(tile.renderAscii())  // the default
   println(tile.renderAscii(AsciiArtEncoder.Palette.STIPLED))

Storage on Azure via HDFS
*************************

By adding some additional configuration, you can now use our
`HDFS Layer Backend <guide/tile-backends.html#hdfs>`__ to read and write GeoTrellis
layers to Microsoft Azure's blob storage.

S3 Configurability
******************

`It's now possible to customize how our S3 backend communicates with S3.
<guide/examples.html#work-with-s3-using-a-custom-s3client-configuration>`__

Configuring JTS Precision
*************************

GeoTrellis uses the `Java Topology Suite <https://github.com/locationtech/jts>`__
for its vector processing. By default, JTS uses a "floating"
`PrecisionModel <https://locationtech.github.io/jts/javadoc/org/locationtech/jts/geom/PrecisionModel.html>`__.
When writing code that needs to be numerically robust, this default can lead to Topology Exceptions.

You can now use `Typesafe Config <https://github.com/lightbend/config>`__ to configure this
to your application's needs. `See here for the specifics. <guide/vectors.html#numerical-precision-and-topology-exceptions>`__

Other New Features
******************

- `Kerberos authentication is available for properly configured Accumulo clusters <https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis/pull/2510>`__
- `Polygonal Summaries for MultibandTiles <https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis/pull/2374>`__
- `Filter GeoTiffRDDs by Geometry <https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis/pull/2409>`__

API Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^

While we are trying to stick strictly to `SemVer <http://semver.org/>`__, there are slight API changes in this release. We felt that while this does break SemVer in the strictest sense, the change were not enough to warrant a 2.0 release. Our hope is in the future to be more cognizant of API changes for future releases.

- Made EPSG capatilization `consistent in method names <https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis/commit/343588b4b066851ea6b35a7d9cc671f4a6d47f2c>`__:

   - In ``geotrellis.proj4.CRS``, changed ``getEPSGCode`` to ``getEpsgCode``
   - In ``geotrellis.proj4.io.wkt.WKT``, changed ``fromEPSGCode`` to ``fromEpsgCode`` and ``getEPSGCode`` to ``getEpsgCode``

- Changed some internal but publicly visible `classes dealing with GeoTiff reading <https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis/pull/1905>`__

   - Changed ``size`` to ``length`` in ``ArraySegmentBytes``
   - Replaced ``foreach`` on SegmentBytes with ``getSegments``, which the caller can iterate over themselves
   - Changed ``getDecompressedBytes`` to ``decompressGeoTiffSegment``
- Changed some interal but publicly visible `implicit classes and read methods around TiffTagReader <https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis/pull/2247>`__
   - Added as an implicit parameter to multiple locations, most publicly in `TiffTagReader.read(byteReader: ByteReader, tagsStartPosition: Long)(implicit ttos: TiffTagOffsetSize)`. Also changed that method from being generic to always taking a `Long` offset.

- Moved some misplaced `implicit JsonFormats <https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis/pull/1919>`__

   - Moved ``CellTypeFormat`` and ``CellSizeFormat`` from `` geotrellis.spark.etl.config.json`` in the ``spark-etl`` subproject to ``geotrellis.raster.io.json.Implicits`` in the ``raster`` subproject.

- Changed LazyLogger `from the com.typesafe.scalalogging version to our own version <https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis/pull/2017>`__

   - This shouldn't break any code, but technically is an API change.

0.10.0
------

The long awaited GeoTrellis 0.10 release is here!

It’s been a while since the 0.9 release of GeoTrellis, and there are
many significant changes and improvements in this release. GeoTrellis
has become an expansive suite of modular components that aide users in
the building of geospatial application in Scala, and as always we’ve
focused specifically on high performance and distributed computing. This
is the first official release that supports working with Apache Spark,
and we are very pleased with the results that have come out of the
decision to support Spark as our main distributed processing engine.
Those of you who have been tuned in for a while know we started with a
custom built processing engine based on Akka actors; this original
execution engine still exists in 0.10 but is in a deprecated state in
the geotrellis-engine subproject. Along with upgrading GeoTrellis to
support Spark and handle arbitrarily-sized raster data sets, we’ve been
making improvements and additions to core functionality, including
adding vector and projection support.

It’s been long enough that release notes, stating what has changed since
0.9, would be quite unwieldy. Instead I put together a list of features
that GeoTrellis 0.10 supports. This is included in the README on the
GeoTrellis Github, but I will put them here as well. It is organized by
subproject, with more basic and core subprojects higher in the list, and
the subprojects that rely on that core functionality later in the list,
along with a high level description of each subproject.

   equality in geometries with an optional threshold.

**geotrellis-raster**

-  Provides types to represent single- and multi-band rasters,
   supporting Bit, Byte, UByte, Short, UShort, Int, Float, and Double
   data, with either a constant NoData value (which improves
   performance) or a user defined NoData value.
-  Treat a tile as a collection of values, by calling "map" and
   "foreach", along with floating point valued versions of those methods
   (separated out for performance).
-  Combine raster data in generic ways.
-  Render rasters via color ramps and color maps to PNG and JPG images.
-  Read GeoTiffs with DEFLATE, LZW, and PackBits compression, including
   horizontal and floating point prediction for LZW and DEFLATE.
-  Write GeoTiffs with DEFLATE or no compression.
-  Reproject rasters from one CRS to another.
-  Resample of raster data.
-  Mask and Crop rasters.
-  Split rasters into smaller tiles, and stitch tiles into larger
   rasters.
-  Derive histograms from rasters in order to represent the distribution
   of values and create quantile breaks.

   represents a coordinate in space based on some uniform grid layout,
   optionally with a temporal component.
-  Represent spatial or spatiotemporal raster data as an RDD of raster
   tiles.
-  Generic architecture for saving/loading layers RDD data and metadata
   to/from various backends, using Spark's IO API with Space Filling
   Curve indexing to optimize storage retrieval (support for Hilbert
   curve and Z order curve SFCs). HDFS and local file system are
