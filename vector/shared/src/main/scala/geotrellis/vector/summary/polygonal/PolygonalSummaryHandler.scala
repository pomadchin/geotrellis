/** This trait provides the scaffolding necessary to generate aggregations
  * which depend on [[Polygon]] and [[MultiPolygon]] instances.
  *
  * @note  This trait specifies the type of operation to be carried out but *NOT* the "zero
  *        element" which determines the beginning value for a chain of operations (like the
  *        starting element in a fold) and *NOT* the [[Polygon]] or [[MultiPolygon]] to be
  *        used during a summary. Instead, those are specified in a call to mergeOp which
  *        returns the function used in an actual summarization.
  *
  * @tparam G  the [[Geometry]] type against which containment and intersection checks are
  *            carried out to determine the flow of aggregation logic
  * @tparam D  the type of any data expected to be associated with G in [[Feature]] instances
  * @tparam T  the type being aggregated to through summary mergeOp calls
  *
  * @param handleContains  the function to be called on a feature when it is determined that
  *                        said feature is contained by the [[Polygon]] or [[MultiPolygon]] used
  *                        in this trait's mergeOp functions
  * @param handleIntersection  the function to be called on a feature when it is determined that
  *                            said feature is not contained by the [[Polygon]] or
  *                            [[MultiPolygon]] used in this trait's mergeOp functions
  * @param combineOp  the function to be called when combining intermedite aggregation results
