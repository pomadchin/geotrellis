API Changes
^^^^^^^^^^^

While we are trying to stick strictly to `SemVer <http://semver.org/>`__, there are slight API changes in this release. We felt that while this does break SemVer in the strictest sense, the change were not enough to warrant a 2.0 release. Our hope is in the future to be more cognizant of API changes for future releases.

- Made EPSG capatilization `consistent in method names <https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis/commit/343588b4b066851ea6b35a7d9cc671f4a6d47f2c>`__:

   - In ``geotrellis.proj4.CRS``, changed ``getEPSGCode`` to ``getEpsgCode``
   - In ``geotrellis.proj4.io.wkt.WKT``, changed ``fromEPSGCode`` to ``fromEpsgCode`` and ``getEPSGCode`` to ``getEpsgCode``

- Changed some internal but publicly visible `classes dealing with GeoTiff reading <https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis/pull/1905>`__

   - Changed ``size`` to ``length`` in ``ArraySegmentBytes``
   - Replaced ``foreach`` on SegmentBytes with ``getSegments``, which the caller can iterate over themselves
   - Changed ``getDecompressedBytes`` to ``decompressGeoTiffSegment``
- Changed some interal but publicly visible `implicit classes and read methods around TiffTagReader <https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis/pull/2247>`__
   - Added as an implicit parameter to multiple locations, most publicly in `TiffTagReader.read(byteReader: ByteReader, tagsStartPosition: Long)(implicit ttos: TiffTagOffsetSize)`. Also changed that method from being generic to always taking a `Long` offset.

- Moved some misplaced `implicit JsonFormats <https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis/pull/1919>`__

   - Moved ``CellTypeFormat`` and ``CellSizeFormat`` from `` geotrellis.spark.etl.config.json`` in the ``spark-etl`` subproject to ``geotrellis.raster.io.json.Implicits`` in the ``raster`` subproject.

- Changed LazyLogger `from the com.typesafe.scalalogging version to our own version <https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis/pull/2017>`__

   - This shouldn't break any code, but technically is an API change.

0.10.0
------

The long awaited GeoTrellis 0.10 release is here!

It’s been a while since the 0.9 release of GeoTrellis, and there are
many significant changes and improvements in this release. GeoTrellis
has become an expansive suite of modular components that aide users in
the building of geospatial application in Scala, and as always we’ve
focused specifically on high performance and distributed computing. This
is the first official release that supports working with Apache Spark,
and we are very pleased with the results that have come out of the
decision to support Spark as our main distributed processing engine.
Those of you who have been tuned in for a while know we started with a
custom built processing engine based on Akka actors; this original
execution engine still exists in 0.10 but is in a deprecated state in
the geotrellis-engine subproject. Along with upgrading GeoTrellis to
support Spark and handle arbitrarily-sized raster data sets, we’ve been
making improvements and additions to core functionality, including
adding vector and projection support.

It’s been long enough that release notes, stating what has changed since
0.9, would be quite unwieldy. Instead I put together a list of features
that GeoTrellis 0.10 supports. This is included in the README on the
GeoTrellis Github, but I will put them here as well. It is organized by
subproject, with more basic and core subprojects higher in the list, and
the subprojects that rely on that core functionality later in the list,
along with a high level description of each subproject.

   in JTS), MultiPolygon, GeometryCollection

   provide a type-safe way to match over possible results of geometries.

   generic data type.

-  Read and write geometries to and from WKT and WKB.

   equality in geometries with an optional threshold.

**geotrellis-raster**

-  Provides types to represent single- and multi-band rasters,
   supporting Bit, Byte, UByte, Short, UShort, Int, Float, and Double
   data, with either a constant NoData value (which improves
   performance) or a user defined NoData value.
-  Treat a tile as a collection of values, by calling "map" and
   "foreach", along with floating point valued versions of those methods
   (separated out for performance).
-  Combine raster data in generic ways.
-  Render rasters via color ramps and color maps to PNG and JPG images.
-  Read GeoTiffs with DEFLATE, LZW, and PackBits compression, including
   horizontal and floating point prediction for LZW and DEFLATE.
-  Write GeoTiffs with DEFLATE or no compression.
-  Reproject rasters from one CRS to another.
-  Resample of raster data.
-  Mask and Crop rasters.
-  Split rasters into smaller tiles, and stitch tiles into larger
   rasters.
-  Derive histograms from rasters in order to represent the distribution
   of values and create quantile breaks.
-  Local Map Algebra operations: Abs, Acos, Add, And, Asin, Atan, Atan2,
   Ceil, Cos, Cosh, Defined, Divide, Equal, Floor, Greater,
   GreaterOrEqual, InverseMask, Less, LessOrEqual, Log, Majority, Mask,

   Mean, Max, Sum.
-  Cost distance operation based on a set of starting points and a
   friction raster.

-  Rasterization of geometries and the ability to iterate over cell
   values covered by geometries.

**geotrellis-spark**

-  Generic way to represent key value RDDs as layers, where the key
   represents a coordinate in space based on some uniform grid layout,
   optionally with a temporal component.
-  Represent spatial or spatiotemporal raster data as an RDD of raster
   tiles.
-  Generic architecture for saving/loading layers RDD data and metadata
   to/from various backends, using Spark's IO API with Space Filling
   Curve indexing to optimize storage retrieval (support for Hilbert
   curve and Z order curve SFCs). HDFS and local file system are

   spatial or spatiotemporal bounds.
