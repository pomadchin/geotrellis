*GeoTrellis* is a Scala library and framework that uses
Spark to work with raster data.  It is released under
the Apache 2 License.

GeoTrellis reads, writes, and operates on raster data
as fast as possible. It implements many
[Map Algebra](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Map_algebra)
operations as well as vector to raster or raster to
vector operations.

GeoTrellis also provides tools to render rasters into
PNGs or to store metadata about raster files as JSON.
It aims to provide raster processing at web speeds (sub-second
or less) with RESTful endpoints as well as provide
fast batch processing of large raster data sets.

Please visit the **[project site](http://geotrellis.io)**
for more information as well as some interactive demos.

#### GeoTrellis with Python

GeoTrellis has Python bindings through a project called [GeoPySpark](http://github.com/locationtech-labs/geopyspark).
GeoPySpark is a Python bindings library for GeoTrellis and can do many
(but not all) of the operations present in GeoTrellis. GeoPySpark can
be integrated with other tools in the Python ecosystem, such as NumPy,  
scikit-learn, and Jupyter notebooks. Several GeoPySpark tutorials have
been developed that leverage the visualization capability of [GeoNotebook](https://github.com/OpenGeoscience/geonotebook), 
an open-source Jupyter extension that provides interactive map displays.

```

## Where is our commit history and contributor list?

In November 2016, GeoTrellis moved it's repository from the
[GeoTrellis GitHub Organization](https://github.com/geotrellis) to it's current
home in the LocationTech GitHub organization.
In the process of moving our repository, we went through an IP review process.
Because the Eclipse foundation only reviews a snapshot of the repository, and
not all of history, we had to start from a clean `master` branch. The entire
old history is available in the `_old/master` branch. You can also tie
your local clone's master history to the old history by running

```console
> git fetch origin refs/replace/*:refs/replace/*
```

if `origin` points to https://github.com/locationtech/geotrellis.
This will allow you to see the old history for commands like `git log`.

Unfortunately, we lost our commit and contributor count in the move.
These are significant statistics for a repository,
and our current counts make us look younger than we are.
GeoTrellis has been an open source project since 2011.
This is what our contributor and commit count looked like
before the move to LocationTech:

![Commit and contributor count before LocationTech move](docs/img/contributor-and-commit-count-pre-locationtech.png)

Along with counts, we want to make sure that all the awesome people
who contributed to GeoTrellis before the LocationTech move can
still be credited on a contributors page. For posterity, I will
leave the following contributors page to what it was before the move:

- Represent spatial or spatiotemporal raster data as an RDD of raster tiles.
- Generic architecture for saving/loading layers RDD data and metadata to/from various backends, using Spark's IO API with Space Filling Curve indexing to optimize storage retrieval (support for Hilbert curve and Z order curve SFCs). HDFS and local file system are supported backends by default, S3 and Accumulo are supported backends by the `geotrellis-s3` and `geotrellis-accumulo` projects, respectively.
